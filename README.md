# Sequence Translator using Python
The objective of this task is to create a Python function that translates a given DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence. This involves mapping codons (three-nucleotide sequences) to their respective amino acids using a predefined codon table.This code serves as a fundamental tool for bioinformatics applications, allowing researchers to translate genetic information into functional proteins efficiently.
